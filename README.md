# Nosql_challenge

This report presents the results of a project that involved utilizing my skills in NoSQL database management system using MongoDB, PyMongo library and the leading database management system. As part of the process, I applied my expertise in building aggregation pipelines to retrieve data and integrated various data skills learned in previous classes such as Pandas, APIs, and Matplotlib.

To start with the project, I imported a JSON file containing food establishment ratings data into a MongoDB database. Using the PyMongo library, I performed basic CRUD operations, selected specific fields, used comparison operators, and utilized sort and limit when retrieving documents from MongoDB.

Furthermore, I used aggregation and aggregation pipelines to analyze a subset of the MongoDB collection. I also converted the MongoDB results to a Pandas DataFrame, imported data from an API and saved it to MongoDB. Additionally, I set data from a MongoDB database to plot charts with Matplotlib.

## Results:
Through the use of MongoDB and PyMongo library, I successfully completed the project objectives. I was able to conduct analysis on the food establishment ratings data to assist a food magazine in making decisions regarding future articles.
